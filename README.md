# First-AI-Agent
My first AI Agent using Google ADK.

# My First AI Agent (ADK Codelab #1)

This is my first AI Agent built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## What it does
It responds to user questions using the Gemini model.

## How to run
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install requirements:   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the agent:    python agent.py


Due to billing restrictions, I was unable to run the API online, but the setup, structure, and code are complete as per the codelab instructions.
